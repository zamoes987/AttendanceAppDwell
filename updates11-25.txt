Android App Enhancement Plan

1. Add Submit Attendance Link
- Integrate a new button or menu item labeled "Submit Attendance".
- Link will be provided by the user; replace placeholder once available.
- Place the link in the appropriate Activity (e.g., AttendanceActivity).
- Add intent to open the URL in a browser or WebView depending on preference.

2. Change Sheet ID
- Identify where the Google Sheet ID is hardcoded (likely in constants or API config file).
- Replace existing ID with the new one.
- Update all references to ensure consistent data routing.
- Test read/write functionality after replacement.

3. Replace Select All with Uncheck All When Active
- On member selection screen, detect when all members are selected.
- Automatically swap the "Select All" button with an "Uncheck All" button.
- Logic:
  - If any member is unchecked → show "Select All".
  - If all members are checked → show "Uncheck All".
- Ensure this is tied into the adapter or ViewModel handling the list.

4. Hide Infrequent Guests Feature
- Add a "Hide" button on the Management Users page.
- Create a Boolean flag per user for "isFrequent".
- When Hide is clicked:
  - Filter out users flagged as infrequent.
  - Refresh view with filtered list.
- Add a way to re-show hidden users, possibly via a toggle.

5. Testing Checklist
- Verify Submit Attendance link opens correctly.
- Verify new sheet ID communicates properly.
- Test Select All → Uncheck All swap under multiple scenarios.
- Test Hide functionality on various user types.
- Confirm no crashes and UI updates smoothly.
